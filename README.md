These are the codes that I wrote in processing software for creating nice graphics.


This repository contains small programs written in 'processing' to create and output various graphics.
Processing is an easy-to-learn language based on Java, and used to create your own graphics easily. 
For more details on processing, you can visit processing.org

Feel free to use and customize this code for your own project. 
To run these pde files, you will need to download processing from their website processing.org.
